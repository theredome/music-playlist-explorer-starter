### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes the topics gave me what I needed to complete the project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added an API so that the songs are actually playable. The website is cool but all it does is look pretty, wish it had more usage.  

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think all I wanted to achieve was done and I'm really happy with my website. I wouldn't really change it except adding the actual songs.
